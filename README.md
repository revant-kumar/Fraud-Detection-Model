# Fraud Transaction Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions based on transaction details. The model is designed to analyze various features of a transaction and determine whether it is normal or fraudulent.

## Features
- Utilizes transaction details as inputs for fraud detection.
- Performs meticulous data preparation on a dataset with 154 features.
- Includes processes such as:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Incorporation of domain-specific data
  - Handling null values
  - Creation of new features through feature engineering

## Methodology
- Developed and fine-tuned a machine learning model to achieve nearly 94% accuracy.
- Employed various machine learning algorithms and compared their performance to identify the most effective approach.

## Repository Structure
- `Online_fraud_detection_practice.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preparation processes, training and evaluating machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/revant-kumar/Fraud-Detection-Model.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Online_fraud_detection_practice.ipynb`) to execute the data preparation and model training processes.
